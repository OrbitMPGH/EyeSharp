# EyeSharp ![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FOrbitMPGH%2FEyeSharp&countColor=%23263759)
Makes it easy to gather and interact with data from [Realmeye](https://www.realmeye.com/)

They have no official API, therefore EyeSharp uses WebScraping to get all the information.

Based on [TheNorthJyde's](https://github.com/TheNorthJyde) repository [RealmeyeSharp](https://github.com/TheNorthJyde/RealmeyeSharp)

# Basic usage
All interactions with EyeSharp is done through the RealmEyeClient class.

## Getting a user
First create an instance of RealmEye

``var api = new RealmEyeClient()``

Then you can get a user with their in-game name:

``var user = await api.GetUser(ign);``
